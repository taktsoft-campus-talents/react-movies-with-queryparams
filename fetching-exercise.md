# Exercise: Movie Quiz

- Add route, a page & a navigation entry "Quiz"
- On the Quiz page, fetch the data from the Open Trivia API
- Show all questions in a list
- Introduce a state variable representing the current question
- Add a button to proceed to the next question
- For each question, display the possible answers
- Make sure to shuffle the possible answers in order to prevent that the first answer is always the correct one.
- If the user chooses the correct answer, highlight the corresponding button in green, otherwise in red (You need state for this!)
- Disable the "Next" button until the user selected an answer
- Bonus: Track the correct answers and display a result (e.g. 4/10 correct answers) at the end of the quiz
